# Python-Scientific-Calculator-
Developed a command-line scientific calculator using Python, capable of performing both basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /, **) and scientific operations such as sqrt, log, sin, cos, and tan.
The program uses safe expression evaluation with the eval() function restricted to the Python math module, preventing unauthorized code execution.
Features include continuous calculations in a loop, custom handling for trigonometric degree-to-radian conversions, and robust error handling for invalid inputs.
